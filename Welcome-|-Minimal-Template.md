Hit `F5` right now and run your new app! To refresh Visual Studio's intellisense, follow this: 

1. Press Ctrl+Q, type `pac man gen` 
1. Ensure `Allow NuGet to download missing packages` is checked.
1. Ensure `Automatically check for missing packages during build in Visual Studio` is checked.  
1. Right-click your Solution, and select `Clean`.
1. Right-click your Solution, and select `Rebuild`.
1. Select your project, and click the `Refresh` button at the top of Solution Explorer.

Congratulations, you can now use your project without "missing assemblies" errors. If you want, return the Package Manager Settings back to their original values. This will make your builds significantly faster.
